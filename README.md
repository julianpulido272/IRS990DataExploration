# IRS990DataExploration
Various scripts used to extract insight on the [IRS 990 bulk data](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-series-downloads) regarding non-profit information. Extracted a subset of non profits and performed k means clustering to find clustering of non profits based on their descriptions.
